Driven by his undying love for his country, Rizal wrote the novel to expose the ills of Philippine society during the Spanish colonial era. At the time, the Spaniards prohibited the Filipinos from reading the controversial book because of the unlawful acts depicted in the novel. Yet they were not able to ban it completely and as more Filipinos read the book, it opened their eyes to the truth that they were being manhandled by the friars. In this revolutionary book, you'll learn the story of Crisostomo Ibarra, how he dealt with Spanish authorities, and how he prepared for his revenge, as told in Rizal's second book, El Filibusterismo.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption class="works_description">This is Rizal's sequel to his first book, Noli Me Tángere. In El Filibusterismo (The Reign of the Greed), the novel exhibits a dark theme (as opposed to the hopeful atmosphere in the first novel) in which it depicts the country's issues and how theprotagonist attempts a reform. The story takes place 13 years after Noli Me Tángere, where revolutionary protagonist Crisostomo Ibarra is now under the guise of Simou - wealthy jewelry tycoon. Because the novel also portrays the abuse, corruption, and discrimination of the Spaniards towards Filipinos, it was also banned in the country at the time. Rizal dedicated his second novel to the GOMBURZA - the Filipino priests named Mariano Gomez, Jose Apolonio Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora who were executed on charges of subversion. The two novels of Rizal, now considered as his literary masterpieces, both indirectly sparked the Philippine Revolution.</figcaption>
